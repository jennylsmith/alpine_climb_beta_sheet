# Approach

**Directions:**

-    from Verlot ranger station

-    head west on Mountain Loop highway (17.6 miles)

-    sharp right (south) onto NF-4065/ sunrise mine road

-   continue 2.2 miles until road ends (2300' elevation)

**Route:** Ragged Edge

-   follow sunrise mine trail (#707) SSE. Cross stillguamish river at 1.5mi

-   Follow tributary of river (climbers left) to headlee pass (4650', \~1.0mi)

-   head west into the basin between Vesper (left) Sperry (right)

-   keeping the basin/lake to your right and continue west \~0.5mi (281Â°) towards a "notch" that leads to vesper glacier.

-   Once past the notch, look to the left for a ledge system to traverse to the climb start


# Pitches

### P1

-   45m, 5.6
-   gear belay at the top of P1 (faint white slab)

### P2

-   25m, 5.7
-   fixed bolted anchor on skyline

### P3 **crux?**

-   30m, 5.7
-   keep bolt on your left, travel up arete
-   gear belay at the top of P3

### P4

-   25m, 5.7
-   steep stacked blocks on crest
-   fixed bolted anchor

### P5 **crux**

-  20m, 5.7
-  Up past 2 bolts
- **\@2nd bolt** traverse 10-15m right 
-  requires the most gear; very exposed, but takes gear well.

### P6

-  40m, 5.6 
-  up arete and hit some heather/vegetation
-  mix of gear, bolts, and pins for pro

  
### Bail Options
-  TBD 


# Trip Plan

-   TH at 7am
-   Follow Sunrise mine TR \~5mi and 3,600' gain. Arrive at ledge (\~4 hrs, ETA 11am)
-   Navigate to vesper north face ledge at 5800' to set-up climb (\~30 min, ETA 11:30am)
-   Climb 210m (\~688') across 6 pitches to summit at 6214' (\~4 hrs, ETA 3:30pm)
-   Summit hangout \~ 15 min
-   **Descent:** Walk-off descent \~1 hr + trail to car \~2 hrs (ETA 6:45pm at cars)

## Decision Points:

- Drop packs where the walk-off descent meets the notch to the ledge?
- How busy are the two routes - ragged edge vs true grit? Consider true grit for alternative 
- **Turn around time: 3:30pm** 
  - Current Sunrise: 6:02am
  - Current sunset: 8:23 pm

# Gear

- #.5 - 1 (x2 each)
- #.2 - .4, 2, 3  (x1 each)
- set of small nuts (x1 each)
- **note:** 1m =\~ 3.3ft
