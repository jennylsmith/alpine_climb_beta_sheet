# Approach

**Directions:**

-   from Verlot ranger station
-   head west on Mountain Loop highway (17.6 miles)
-   sharp right (south) onto NF-4065/ sunrise mine road
-   continue 2.2 miles until road ends (2300' elevation)

**Route:** Ragged Edge

-   follow sunrise mine trail (#707) SSE. Cross stillguamish river at 1.5mi
-   Follow tributary of river (climbers left) to headlee pass (4650', \~1.0mi)
-   a bit tricky on boulder section before Headlee Pass
-   arrow marked on a big rock
-   head west into the basin between Vesper (left) Sperry (right)
-   keeping the basin/lake to your right and continue west \~0.5mi (281Â°) towards a "notch" that leads to vesper glacier.
-   Once past the notch, look to the left for a ledge system to traverse to the climb start
-   climb starts on the far right of the ledge, exposed scramble down and around a rock buttress

# Pitches

**Route finding is the main crux** of the route since the face is slabby/devoid of cracks

### P1

-   45m, 5.6
-   route starts after passing the buttress on the ledge on an obvious layback flake
-   gear belay at the top of P1 (faint white slab)

### P2

-   25m, 5.7
-   climb past 3 bolts; traverse right and up small gully
-   fixed bolted anchor on skyline

### P3 **crux?**

-   30m, 5.7
-   keep bolt on your left, travel up arete
-   gear belay at the top of P3

### P4

-   25m, 5.7
-   steep stacked blocks on crest
-   fixed bolted anchor

### P5 **crux**

-   20m, 5.7
-   Up past 2 bolts
-   **\@2nd bolt** traverse 10-15m right
-   requires the most gear; very exposed, but takes gear well.
-   shallow flared cracks, slabby exposure traverse, exposed belay station
-   follower can climb down a step or two and back up; making a potential fall less dramatic.
-   fixed bolted anchor

### P6

-   40m, 5.6
-   up arete and hit some heather/vegetation
-   mix of gear, bolts, and pins for pro

### Bail Options

-   if stuck at 5th pitch, rappelling back down the way we came
-   venturing off route could be a challenge to bail from, especially if lichen and moss.

# Trip Plan

-   TH at 6:30am, walking at 7am
-   Follow Sunrise mine TR \~5mi and 3,600' gain. Arrive at ledge (\~4 hrs, ETA 11am)
-   Navigate to vesper north face ledge at 5800' to set-up climb
-   likely additional climbing parties to wait behind (\~1.5 hrs, ETA 12:30pm)
-   Climb 210m (\~688') across 6 pitches to summit at 6214' (\~4 hrs, ETA 4:30pm)
-   Summit hangout \~ 30 min
-   **Descent:** Walk-off descent \~1 hr + trail to car \~2 hrs (ETA 8:00pm at cars)

| Decision points                                                        | Gear                           |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| \- Drop packs where the walk-off descent meets the notch to the ledge? | \- Rock rack                   |
| \- How busy are the two routes - ragged edge vs true grit?             | \- #.5 - 1 (x2 each)           |
| \- **Turn around time: 3:30pm**                                        | \- #.2 - .4, 2, 3 (x1 each)    |
| \- Current Sunrise: 6:02am                                             | \- set of small nuts (x1 each) |
| \- Current sunset: 8:23 pm                                             | \- Rope (70m)                  |

## Current Conditions (Aug 2023)

-   multiple streams to filter on way down from summit
-   All bolts, including belay stations, are nice and shiny
-   No snow on the approach ledges; minimal snow elsewhere.
-   Little snow was easily navigated in trail runners without traction or ice axes
